A pipeline that extracts T cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 sequences from 10X multimodal single cell data, and returns cluster annotations labelled with peptide-MHC specificity. This work relies heavily on the excellent tutorials provided by the Scanpy, Scirpy and ClusTCR libraries available via the following repositories
